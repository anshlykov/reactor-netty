= HTTP Client

Reactor Netty provides the easy-to-use and easy-to-configure
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpClient.html[`HttpClient`].
It hides most of the Netty functionality that is required to create a `HTTP` client
and adds Reactive Streams backpressure.

== Connect

To connect the `HTTP` client to a given `HTTP` endpoint, you must create and configure a
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpClient.html[`HttpClient`] instance.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/connect/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/connect/Application.java[lines=18..32]
----
<1> Creates a {javadoc}/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]
instance ready for configuring.
<2> Specifies that `GET` method will be used.
<3> Specifies the path.
<4> Obtains the response {javadoc}/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpClientResponse.html[HttpClientResponse]
====


The following example uses `WebSocket`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/websocket/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/websocket/Application.java[lines=18..42]
----
====

=== Host and Port

In order to connect to a specific host and port, you can apply the following configuration to the `HTTP` client:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/address/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/address/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
<1> Configures the `HTTP` host
<2> Configures the `HTTP` port
====

== Writing Data

To send data to a given `HTTP` endpoint, you can provide a `Publisher` by using the
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpClient.RequestSender.html#send-org.reactivestreams.Publisher-[`send(Publisher)`] method.
By default, `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is applied for those `HTTP` methods for which
a request body is expected. `Content-Length` provided through request headers disables `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`,
if necessary. The following example sends `hello`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/send/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/send/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
<1> Sends a `hello` string to the given `HTTP` endpoint
====

=== Adding Headers and Other Metadata

When sending data to a given `HTTP` endpoint, you may need to send additional headers, cookies and other metadata.
You can use the following configuration to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/send/headers/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/send/headers/Application.java[lines=18..38]
----
<1> Disables `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` and provides `Content-Length` header.
====

==== Compression

You can enable compression on the `HTTP` client, which means the request header
`Accept-Encoding` is added to the request headers. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/compression/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/compression/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
====

==== Auto-Redirect Support

You can configure the `HTTP` client to enable auto-redirect support.

Reactor Netty provides two different strategies for auto-redirect support:

* `followRedirect(boolean)`: Specifies whether HTTP auto-redirect support is enabled for statuses `301|302|307|308`.
* `followRedirect(BiPredicate<HttpClientRequest, HttpClientResponse>)`: Enables auto-redirect support if the supplied
predicate matches.

The following example uses `followRedirect(true)`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/redirect/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/redirect/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
====

== Consuming Data

To receive data from a given `HTTP` endpoint, you can use one of the methods from
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpClient.ResponseReceiver.html[`HttpClient.ResponseReceiver`].
The following example uses the `responseContent` method:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/read/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/read/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Receives data from a given `HTTP` endpoint
<2> Aggregates the data
<3> Transforms the data as string
====

=== Reading Headers and Other Metadata

When receiving data from a given `HTTP` endpoint, you can check response headers, status code, and other metadata.
You can obtain this additional metadata by using
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpClientResponse.html[`HttpClientResponse`].
The following example shows how to do so.

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/read/status/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/read/status/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
<1> Obtains the status code.
====

=== HTTP Response Decoder

By default, `Netty` configures some restrictions for the incoming responses, such as:

* The maximum length of the initial line.
* The maximum length of all headers.
* The maximum length of the content or each chunk.

For more information, see https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpResponseDecoder.html[`HttpResponseDecoder`]

By default, the `HTTP` client is configured with the following settings:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-http/src/main/java/reactor/netty/http/HttpDecoderSpec.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/http/HttpDecoderSpec.java[lines=31..35]
----
====
====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-http/src/main/java/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpResponseDecoderSpec.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpResponseDecoderSpec.java[lines=35..43]
----
====

When you need to change these default settings, you can configure the `HTTP` client as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/responsedecoder/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/responsedecoder/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
<1> The maximum length of all headers will be `16384`.
When this value is exceeded, a
https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/codec/TooLongFrameException.html[TooLongFrameException]
is raised.
====

== TCP-level Configuration

When you need configurations on a TCP level, you can use the following snippet
to extend the default `TCP` client configuration (add an option, bind address etc.):

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/channeloptions/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/channeloptions/Application.java[lines=18..40]
----
====

See <<tcp-client>> for more about `TCP` level configurations.

=== Wire Logger

Reactor Netty provides wire logging for when the traffic between the peers needs to be inspected.
By default, wire logging is disabled.
To enable it, you must set the logger `reactor.netty.http.client.HttpClient` level to `DEBUG`
and apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/wiretap/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/wiretap/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
<1> Enables the wire logging
====

== SSL andTLS
When you need SSL or TLS, you can apply the configuration shown in the next example.
By default, if `OpenSSL` is available, a
https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#OPENSSL[`SslProvider.OPENSSL`]
provider is used as a provider. Otherwise a
https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#JDK[SslProvider.JDK] provider is used
You can switch the provider by using
https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslContextBuilder.html#sslProvider-io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider-[`SslContextBuilder`]
or by setting `-Dio.netty.handler.ssl.noOpenSsl=true`.
The following example uses `SslContextBuilder`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/security/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/security/Application.java[lines=18..37]
----
====

== Retry Strategies
By default, the `HTTP` client retries the request once if it was aborted on the `TCP` level.

== Metrics
The HTTP client supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/[`Micrometer`].
It exposes all metrics with a prefix of `reactor.netty.http.client`.

The following table provides information for the HTTP client metrics:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| metric name | type | description
| reactor.netty.http.client.data.received | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data received, in bytes
| reactor.netty.http.client.data.sent | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data sent, in bytes
| reactor.netty.http.client.errors | Counter | Number of errors that occurred
| reactor.netty.http.client.tls.handshake.time | Timer | Time spent for TLS handshake
| reactor.netty.http.client.connect.time | Timer | Time spent for connecting to the remote address
| reactor.netty.http.client.address.resolver | Timer | Time spent for resolving the address
| reactor.netty.http.client.data.received.time | Timer | Time spent in consuming incoming data
| reactor.netty.http.client.data.sent.time | Timer | Time spent in sending outgoing data
| reactor.netty.http.client.response.time | Timer | Total time for the request/response
|=======

These additional metrics are also available:

include::conn-provider-metrics.adoc[]

include::alloc-metrics.adoc[]

The following example enables that integration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/metrics/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/metrics/Application.java[lines=18..51]
----
<1> Applies upper limit for the meters with `URI` tag
<2> Templated URIs will be used as an URI tag value when possible
<3> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer
====

NOTE: In order to avoid a memory and CPU overhead of the enabled metrics, it is important to convert the real URIs to templated URIs when possible.
Without a conversion to a template-like form, each distinct URI leads to the creation of a distinct tag, which takes a lot of memory for the metrics.

NOTE: Always apply an upper limit for the meters with URI tags. Configuring an upper limit on the number of meters can help in cases when the real URIs cannot be templated.
You can find more information at https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_denyaccept_meters[`maximumAllowableTags`].

When HTTP client metrics are needed for an integration with a system other than `Micrometer` or you want
to provide your own integration with `Micrometer`, you can provide your own metrics recorder, as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
./../../reactor-netty-examples/src/main/java/reactor/netty/examples/documentation/http/client/metrics/custom/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/metrics/custom/Application.java[lines=18..37]
----
<1> Enables HTTP client metrics and provides {javadoc}/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpClientMetricsRecorder.html[`HttpClientMetricsRecorder`] implementation.
====
